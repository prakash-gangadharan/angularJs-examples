<dfn>features of java</dfn>
<dt>Simple and Powerful</dt>
<dd>Unlike other programming systems that they provide dozens of complicated ways to
perform a simple task.</dd>


<dt>Secure</dt>
<dd>Using Java Compatible Browser, anyone can safely download Java applets without the fear
of viral infection or malicious intent because of its key design principle.</dd>


<dt>Portable</dt>
<dd>Many types of computers and operating systems are in use throughout the world—and
many are connected to the Internet.</dd>


<dt>Objectoriented</dt>
<dd>Java support the all the features of object oriented programming language such as
Abstraction, Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism and Dynamic binding etc….</dd>


<dt>Robust</dt>
<dd>memory management mistakes and mishandled exceptional conditions</dd>


<dt>Multithreaded</dt>
<dd>Java supports programming, which allows the user to write programs that perform many
functions simultaneously.</dd>


<dt>Architectureneutral</dt>
<dd>The Java designers worked hard in achieving their goal “write once; run anywhere,
anytime, forever” and as a result the Java Virtual Machine was developed.</dd>


<dt>Interpreted and High performance</dt>
<dd>The source code is first compile and generates the code into an intermediate representation
called Java bytecode which is a highly optimized set of instruction code.</dd>


<dt>Distributed</dt>
<dd>allows the object can access the information across the network with the help of RMI
(Remote Method Invocation)</dd>


<dt>Dynamic</dt>
<dd>Java programs carry with them substantial amounts of runtime
type information that is
used to verify and resolve accesses to objects at run time.</dd>
